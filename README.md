# vagrant-bindfs

A Vagrant plugin to automate [bindfs](http://code.google.com/p/bindfs/) mount in the VM.
This allow you to change owner, group and permissions on files and, for example, work around NFS share permissions issues.

## Some Background: Why `vagrant-bindfs`

The default vagrant provider is [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
It's free, and it works well, but it has some [performance problems](http://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/609-Slow-IO-performance-with-Vagrant-and-VirtualBox-).

People often recommend switching to [vagrant's VMWare-fusion provider](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware).
This reportedly has better performance, but shares with symlinks [won't work](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/428199?start=0&tstart=0)
You also have to buy both the plugin and VMWare-fusion.

The final recommendation, at least on Linux/OSX hosts, is to [use nfs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/nfs.html).
However, an NFS mount has the same numeric permissions in the guest as in the host.
If you're on OSX, for instance, a folder owned by the default OSX user will appear to be [owned by `501:20`](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/vagrant-up/qXXJ-AQuKQM) in the guest.

This is where `vagrant-bindfs` comes in!
Simply:

- mount your share over NFS into a temporary location in the guest
- re-mount the share to the actual destination with `vagrant-bindfs`, setting the correct permissions

## Installation

Vagrant-bindfs is distributed as a Ruby gem.
You can install it as any other Vagrant plugin with `vagrant plugin install vagrant-bindfs`.

## Usage

In your `Vagrantfile`, use `config.bindfs.bind_folder` to configure folders that will be binded on VM startup.
The format is:
```ruby
     config.bindfs.bind_folder "/path/to/source", "/path/to/destination", options
```

### Example

```ruby
    Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
    
      [...] # Your VM configuration

      # Basic usage
      config.bindfs.bind_folder "source/dir", "mount/point"
      
      # Advanced options
      config.bindfs.bind_folder "source/dir", "mount/point", :perms => "u=rw:g=r:o=r", :create_as_user => true
        
      # Complete example for a NFS shared folder
      config.vm.network :hostonly, "33.33.33.10" # (required to use NFS shared folder)
      config.vm.share_folder "nfs-share", "/vagrant-nfs", "host/source/dir", :nfs => true 
      config.bindfs.bind_folder "/vagrant-nfs", "guest/mount/point"
        
    end
```

### Supported options

`bind_folder` supports the following arguments:

- `:owner` (defaults to 'vagrant')
- `:group` (defaults to 'vagrant')
- `:perms` (defaults to 'u=rwX:g=rD:o=rD')
- `:mirror`
- `:'mirror-only'`
- `:'create-for-user'`
- `:'create-for-group'`
- `:'create-with-perms'`

... and following flags (all disabled by default, vagrant-bindfs rely on bindfs own defaults) :

- `:'no-allow-other'`
- `:'create-as-user'`
- `:'create-as-mounter'`
- `:'chown-normal'`
- `:'chown-ignore'`
- `:'chown-deny'`
- `:'chgrp-normal'`
- `:'chgrp-ignore'`
- `:'chgrp-deny'`
- `:'chmod-normal'`
- `:'chmod-ignore'`
- `:'chmod-deny'`
- `:'chmod-allow-x'`
- `:'xattr-none'`
- `:'xattr-ro'`
- `:'xattr-rw'`
- `:'ctime-from-mtime'`
    
You can overwrite default options _via_ `config.bindfs.default_options`.

See [bindfs man page](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/partel/bindfs_docs/bindfs.1.html) for details.

vagrant-bindfs does not check compatibility between given arguments but warn you when a binding command fail or if bindfs is not installed on your virtual machine.
On Debian systems, it will try to install bindfs automatically.

## Contributing

If you find this plugin useful, we could use a few enhancements!
In particular, capabilities files for installing vagrant-bindfs on systems other than Debian would be useful.
We could also use some specs...

### How to Test Changes

If you've made changes to this plugin, you can easily test it locally in vagrant.
From the root of the repo, do:

- `bundle install`
- `rake build`
- `bundle exec vagrant up`

This will spin up a default Debian VM and try to bindfs-mount some shares in it.
Feel free to modify the included `Vagrantfile` to add additional test cases.
